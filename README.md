# docx test app

A simple [docx](https://github.com/dolanmiu/docx) 
testing app created with Create-React-App 

Shading within docx currently only shades *text* - 
not *whole paragraphs*.

The difference can be seen in the included document : 
[CreatedInWord_365ProPlus_v2002.docx](https://github.com/jamesdefant/docx-test/blob/master/src/docs/CreatedInWord_365ProPlus_v2002.docx)
, which, as it's name suggests, was created in Word.

### To create shading in Word:
1. Make your selection:
   
   To create **shaded _text_**, select *only* the text you want to shade. 
   
   To create a **shaded _paragraph_**, select the *entire paragraph*. **_Notice how the selection extends a character past the last character._**
 
2. On the **Home** tab, in the **Paragraph** group click the arrow next to **Shading**.
3. Under **Theme Colors**, click the color you want to use to shade your selection..
